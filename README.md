# JavaScript-Quiz

## The Goal
I was tasked to develop a quiz for users to take to test their JavaScript knowledge. This task helped me understand and further develop my JavaScript skills along with practicing DOM manipulation to get the desired results.

## How I Planned The Quiz
I decided to deconstruct the quiz into 4 parts/phases. Start, Quizz, Submit, and End/Highscore.
  - Start: First screen user is introduced to. The only purpose is to start the quiz/proceed to the next phase. Once started a timer will count down immediately on the top bar.
  - Quiz: Here the timer will start to tick down from 30 seconds, this is done in JS. Below will display the question and 4 buttons with answers to choose from. These are generated in JS and pulled from an array. Along with this, on the bottom bar, depending on what the user selects there will be a right or wrong text that pops up and some text to display what question they are on. Once the quiz is finished or the timer runs to 0, the user will be pushed to the next phase.
  - Submit: here the user has displayed the score they got (done by counting how many right answers in the last section). They are prompted to submit their username and will get pushed to the next phase once done.
  - Highscore: Will be a display of the user's score from their current attempt along with the name they submitted. It will also show previous attempts. Users can clear the high scores. Users will also be able to play again and restart the phases (goes to phase 1)


## HTML

## CSS
The CSS was very straightforward, only two key things to mention:
